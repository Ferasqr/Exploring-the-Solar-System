# Exploring the Solar System

Exploring the Solar System is an exciting project that allows you to embark on an immersive journey through a 3D model of our solar system. With real-time rendering capabilities, users can pilot their spaceship and freely navigate through the cosmos. Witness the mesmerizing movement of planets, stars, and other celestial objects through an accurate simulation.

## Features

1. **Dynamic 3D Model:** Immerse yourself in a visually stunning 3D representation of the solar system.
2. **Real-Time Rendering:** Enjoy seamless and responsive navigation as you explore the cosmos.
3. **Planetary Motion Simulation:** Experience the accurate movement of planets and celestial bodies as they orbit the Sun.
4. **Spaceship Controls:** Use the following keys to control the spaceship:
   - `W` - Move forward
   - `A` - Strafe left
   - `S` - Move backward
   - `D` - Strafe right
   - `Q` - Rotate the spaceship counterclockwise
   - `R` - Move the spaceship up
   - `F` - Move the spaceship down
   - `Z` - Increase spaceship speed
   - `C` - Decrease spaceship speed
   - `Space` - Restore default spaceship speed
5. **Camera Controls:** Use the arrow keys to control the camera movement and observe the solar system from different angles.
6. **C++ with Vulkan Framework:** The project is built using the powerful combination of C++ programming language and the Vulkan framework.
7. **Shader Development:** Carefully crafted shaders enhance the visual realism of the game.
